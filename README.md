# Getting Started With FastAPI

In this piece of code, I learned about FastAPI and how to use it to create production-ready APIs  
that have best practices by default while providing the best developer experience possible. 

I learned how to:
- Use path parameters to get a unique URL path per item
- Receive JSON data in requests using pydantic
- Use API best practices like validation, serialization, and documentation

Tools and stack: #python #FastAPI #pydantic
